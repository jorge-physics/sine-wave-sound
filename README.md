# Sine Wave Superposition with Sound

This project visualizes the superposition of two sine waves and allows you to hear their combined frequencies. Adjust the sliders to change the wavelengths of the waves, and observe the background color and tone change based on the modulation frequency.

## Features
- **Dynamic Wave Visualization**: View the superposition of two sine waves.
- **Interactive Sound Generation**: Hear the tones corresponding to the combined frequencies.
- **Background Modulation**: Background color changes based on modulation frequency.

## How to Use
1. Open the webpage.
2. Adjust the sliders to change the wavelengths.
3. Click "Play Sound" to hear the tones.
4. Click "Stop Sound" to stop the audio.
